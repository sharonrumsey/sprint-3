Reflections on Chapter 2 "Search Inside Yourself"

Mindfulness trains your Attention and your Meta-Attention

Attention = taking possession by mind in clear and vivid form

Meta-Attention = knowing when your attention has wandered and is the secret to concentration via micro-recoveries (like balancing on a bike).

Reminds me of a statment someone made to me once when discussing a bad situation in my life.  "It is what it is."
I felt so relaxed to hear those words.  The meaning is that you can fight against life but you would only exhaust yourself against the reality that life has it's highs and lows.  Just take a breath and concentrate on yourself and your own well being.  With that you can then give more freely of yourself since you placed yourself first.  It is what is it is and you go with that instead of trying to change it.  Acceptance is breathing.  Being who you are.
