Written reflections on posture

Posture can be very important - or at least one should return their mind to it and as concentrating on your breathing in meditation you should have your body return itself to the better posture to take that breath as well.

If you look at the whole self then using better posture in sitting and standing and in moving around can only improve your well being.

In meditation your posture should be optimized for alertness and relaxation.
In breathing and taking a deep breath it will help you if you have better posture.

Observe your posture through the week - see if you can get closer to an upright position.
  - My posture has improved and I'm taking a conscious effort to stop hunching over my keyboard.  I at time will work sitting crossed legged on the bed with the laptop on a tray and my back flat against the wall/pillow for support.  
  1. Does it affect - or is it effected - by your mental state?
  - I think it can affect your mood if your body feels stressed.  I like to get up periodically and do something else in the house.  It's good to move about - also sometimes this action helps me return to my studies refreshed and then I'm able to see what I was getting wrong or where I was making mistakes.

  2. Do you feel any pain in your back, neck, shoulders, writs or elsewhere that may be related?
  - I have some problems with my neck and shoulders - so I take time to scrunch my neck and shoulders at time to relieve them.  Also, my right wrist does have some problems at time, but that was more so when I did full time work as a "digital paper pusher" - loads of mouse work.  I am consciously trying to use more keyboard controls over mouse now.
