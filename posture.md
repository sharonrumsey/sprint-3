Written reflections on posture

Posture can be very important - or at least one should return their mind to it and as concentrating on your breathing in meditation you should have your body return itself to the better posture to take that breath as well.

If you look at the whole self then using better posture in sittin and standing and in moving around can only improve your well being.

In meditation your posture should be optimized for alertness and relaxation.
In breathing and taking a deep breath it will help you if you have better posture.
