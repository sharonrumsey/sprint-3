Reflections on Chapter 3 "Search Inside Yourself"

You should practice mindfulness while in activity as well as when in meditation.

You should gravitate towards pleasant feelings when your practice mindfulness.  It should increase your happiness.

Practicing mindfulness daily will increase your ability to do so for longer periods of time and in doing all activity - not just sitting with your eyes closed in a static state.

You can practice the mindfulness in activity - such as in walking.  It can help in problem solving.  

Also you can apply mindfulness towards others by giving others in your day your full attention through listening with intent.

Looping is giving feedback to someone through listening to what you heard them say. And dipping is checking within making sure that we don't become distracted when we should be actively listening to others.

Giving feedback can insure that you re-state what you thought you heard and the person you are in conversation with can do the same ensuring that you are both heard and satisfied that you both had a meaningful and connected conversation.

Do your mindfulness as long as it doesn't become like a chore.

Have both focused and open attention.
