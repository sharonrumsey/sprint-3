Reflections on "The Empathic Civilization" video

Humans are "soft-wired" to experience what someone else is feeling.

Socially we wish to belong with others.

Self-hood is the increasing of self development and understanding the human nature or life and death.

Empathizing with each other is part of the solidarity with others.

Empathy is apart of the living and being apart of life.

Empathize = Civilization (evolution of the growth of human nature through association with others like and different from us).

Technology can help in this connection.

Log your refelctions:
1. Is an empathic civilization possible?

2. How would we work towards that goal?

3. Is this something you believe is worth your time and effort to pursue?

4. What are the possible downsides of pursuing it?  Or not pursuing it?
