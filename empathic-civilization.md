Reflections on "The Empathic Civilization" video

Humans are "soft-wired" to experience what someone else is feeling.

Socially we wish to belong with others.

Self-hood is the increasing of self development and understanding the human nature or life and death.

Empathizing with each other is part of the solidarity with others.

Empathy is apart of the living and being apart of life.

Empathize = Civilization (evolution of the growth of human nature through association with others like and different from us).

Technology can help in this connection.

Log your refelctions:
1. Is an empathic civilization possible?
Gosh I hope so, but I think it would need to be tempered with understanding that people are so different.  There will be (as always) people that will be more in-tuned to it then others will be.  Some will be more empathic than another.  Your "selfhood" will be defined by your experiences in life and some will not develop it as others.

2. How would we work towards that goal?
Working toward that goal will need to be incremental and it will have periods of poor or slow progress

3. Is this something you believe is worth your time and effort to pursue?
I think as a parent we need to try and teach our children how to show empathic understanding - showing a solidarity with others on this planet that we are together in this venture of living on this planet.

4. What are the possible downsides of pursuing it?  Or not pursuing it?
To maintain the "fiction" that we are separate from each other due to how we define ourselves then all attempts at creating a whole social empathy will be very difficult.  But we can take comfort that there are periods when we seem as a whole to show this empathy during moments of extreme difficulties such as 9/11 and hurricanes and earthquakes around the world.
