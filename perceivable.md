Watched TeamTreeHouse video on "Accessibility - Hearing, Vision, Mobility and Cognition".

1. Accessibility is the right thing to do.
2. Accessibility leads to good practice.
3. Accessibility helps to avoid legal concerns.
--W3C-- www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2.0/  for guidelines

Color Blindness - assuring enough contrasts on the websites
Mobile Devices - Increasing use to access the internet
Future may have new technolgies not yet available at this time.

Search spiders look for relevant contents through semantic tags - need solid html markup to utilize - SOL search engine optimization

Accessibiiity for everyone - guiding principle - Web standards and best practices
Screen reading software

Vision Impairments - (not just blindness)
--Color Blindness: red/green and others that only see in monochrome
  Solution: check for contrast - view your site in grey scale 
  Use the website www.spurapp.com to view your site to test for vision impairments
  Don't rely only on color for sep of articles
--Low or poor eyesight: reduced vision that isn't correctable
  low light perception & vision block - can check by looking at a blurry version of your website so you can make important areas more visable or magnified / enlarged font size
  Don't put text in your images
  Add widget so visitors can adjust text size on webpage or use larger fonts
  No flashing text or scrolling text

Techniques for users on your website for using screen reading software:
  The screen reader 
  Download the web developer toolbar for Firefox or Chrome
  Disable images and css so only view in plain html - alt attributes are read in screen readers so you should fill in this on your page - so set a value
  or give a brief description of the image.

Hearing: provide a transcipt if possible for podcasts 
  close caption can be added to videos - best if added manually
  can be added into YouTube videos
  1. Don't rely on only audio for your site
  2. Set audio levels carefully and consistently - appropriate level
  3. Allow for mono audio, if possible for only hearing in one ear

Mobility & Cognition
  Difficulty for using mouse and keyboard
  1. Make all your site keyboard control - try to provide a workable alternative
  2. Give time for people to click on something - slow down on moving items
  3. Provide keyboard shortcuts or cut down on clickin or make large clickable areas
  4. Make it clear so you cut down on "miss clicks"
  5. Make large clickable areas to click or enter text
  Make a clear and usable interface - possible to create a "simplyfied" version of the site

Give feedback on what you learned from reading about perceivability, including whether you agree with the information, how important you think it is to web development, and how you see it affecting your approach to web site design.  

Important to make your website as inclusive as possible so everyone can enjoy using it.

What could you do to make your web sites or applications more perceivable?

-Don't make it too busy - no jumping or moving of text/images
-Make clickable areas easy to use or for text entry via a keyboard
-Provide translation or caption if a video is on the site
-Make it easy for the screen reader to interpret your site.
-Check the contrast for grayscale
