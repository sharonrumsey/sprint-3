Reflections on your accountability group's thoughts and feelings 


1.  Discuss the week's work (difficulties, questions, solutions)
    --Peer sessions with Gaynor this week and discussed some work experience and other things happening in our lives.

2.  Discuss the week.  How is your experience? Are there other things going on that are affecting people's learning?
    --Discussed with Gaynor and other cohorts via Slack this week about my steep learning curve on picking up use of 
    JavaScript.

3.  Any lack of engagement? 
    --None that I am aware of at this time.

4.  Give feedback on each other's solutions: 
    --Through conversations either in appear.in or through Slack I've been finding people experiencing the same 
    as I regarding steep learning curve in picking up JavaScript and yet there seem to be some in our cohort 
    that are doing much better at it and I hope to learn from them on how best to pick it up.
